The employee was utilizing a personal fall arrest system (PFAS) which included a harness connected to a rope-grab. The rope-grab was designed to slide along a rope-lifeline which was connected to a standard roof anchor. The employee lost his footing and began sliding down the roof to the edge where he subsequently fell to the ground below. It was determined that the locking snap hook on the lifeline unintentionally disengaged from the anchor to which it was connected to. The locking snap hook was determined to be compatible with the anchor, but there was a manufacturer defect in the lifeline. The lifeline manufacturer connected one end of the lifeline/rope to a locking snap hook via a metal eyelet. The eyelet was large and could be rotated in such a way where it contacted one of the two latches of the snap hook.  With one latch depressed the other latch opened due to a side load that was caused from the anchor.  This caused the lifeline to detach from the anchor, thus causing the fall protection system to fail.

Coworker #1, who was operating a forklift with roofing materials on its forks, instructed Employee #1 to go up on the roof and find a solid and safe place where the materials could be dropped off. The building was empty inside and covered only by a partial roof composed of sheet metal. The roof was slightly sloped and included four skylights. Each skylight was approximately 3 feet by 10 feet and covered with corrugated fiberglass. Employee #1 was walking on the roof when he disappeared from Coworker #1's sight. Coworker #1 quickly accessed the roof in the scissor lift but did not see Employee #1. He did see a broken skylight. Employee #1 had fallen through the skylight to the concrete floor below, a fall height of 17 feet. Coworker #1 called for emergency services, and the Central County Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to San Francisco General Hospital where he was admitted and treated for multiple fractures and other injuries to his head and face and other parts. He remained at San Francisco General Hospital for 10 days and then was transferred to John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek for an additional 11 days. The Central County Fire Department reported this event to Cal/OSHA at approximately 8:20 a.m. on April 3, 2014. During the subsequent investigation, both Coworker #1 and Employee #1 were interviewed. Coworker #1 stated that Employee #1 was new at this jobsite. He stated he had warned Employee #1 about the existing skylight hazards on the roof. He also said that Employee #1 was not required to wear fall protection because employees wear fall protection only when they actually start working on the roof. Coworker #1 showed the investigator two body harnesses which were present at the jobsite but were not used. Employee #1 stated that he was employed as a laborer with this company for eight months prior to his fall, but he had no experience in roofing. It was his first day at this jobsite and the first time he went onto the roof where he was injured. Employee #1 stated that, upon his supervisor's (Coworker #1) direction, he used the scissor lift to go up on the roof with a bucket of tools. He stated he did not recall what happened on the roof to cause his fall. Employee #1 stated that he was not warned by his supervisor about the existing hazard of skylights. The investigator examined several pieces of the broken skylight cover that had been found. This cover was thin and fragile and failed to meet the requirement of T8 CCR 3212(e). Based on the statements and observations, the investigation concluded that the employer did not ensure that Employee #1 was protected from the existing hazard of the skylights, which were not covered or guarded as required. At the time of this report, Cal/OSHA planned to cite the employer for a serious accident related violation of T8 CCR 3212(e).","Keywords: SKYLIGHT, FRACTURE, HEAD, INSTALLING, ROOF, CONSTRUCTION, ROOFER, FALL, FALL PROTECTION, UNGUARDED",Commercial building,Alteration or rehabilitation,"Under $50,000",17,,,,Hospitalized injury,Construction laborers,63,49,51.0,42.0,13,30.11,06:56:00,50 °F,46 °F,86 %,S,30.09 in,0.0 in,Cloudy,94010,CA,Spring,5 mph,0 mph,37.5820879,-122.3563195,CA 94010,2014-04-03,,,,,

The previous shake-style roof had been removed by another employer. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 were installing plywood sheathing around a chimney extending from the roof. The roof had a 5:12 pitch (22.5 degrees). Employee #1 was on his knees near the gutter when, according to his subsequent statement, he began to feel the sensation of falling over. He tried unsuccessfully to recover his balance by grabbing hold of the gutter. Employee #1 fell from the roof. He landed on his right side on the concrete patio surface below, a fall height of 8 feet 6 inches. Emergency services were called, and the local fire department responded. Employee #1 initially was transported by ambulance to a hospital in Pleasanton, CA. He remained at the hospital for 1 to 2 hours. He then was transported to a hospital in Castro Valley, CA, for 24 hours of observation. He then was transported to a hospital in Oakland, CA for treatment. Approximately two weeks after his fall, at a hospital in Walnut Creek, CA, Employee #1 underwent surgery for a fractured foot/ankle. He remained hospitalized for more than 24 hours. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the employer at approximately 8:15 a.m. on March 18, 2014. The subsequent investigation determined that the employer had been contracted to install a new composite roof complete with plywood sheathing. Photographs and observations of the damaged gutter by the chimney were consistent with Employee #1's statements that he tried to use the gutter to recover his balance. At the time of Employee #1's fall, he was working within his trade, at the task assigned to him, and he was not a supervisor. During the opening conference held at the job site, the Associate Safety Engineer performing the investigation requested to see the company's Code of Safe Practices, but the owner did not have it at the site. In addition, the employer did not provide Cal/OSHA with a copy of its Illness and Injury Prevention Program and Heat Illness Prevention Program upon written request.","Keywords: FRACTURE, INSTALLING, CONSTRUCTION, DIZZINESS, ROOFER, FALL, FALL PROTECTION, LOST BALANCE, ANKLE, FOOT",Single family or duplex dwelling,Maintenance or repair,"Under $50,000",8,,,,Hospitalized injury,Roofers,68,48,48.0,41.0,18,30.2,08:53:00,53 °F,47 °F,80 %,SE,30.10 in,0.0 in,Mostly Cloudy,94551,CA,Spring,5 mph,0 mph,37.701536,-121.774072,CA 94551,2014-03-17,,,,,

Employee #1's immediate task was to install roofing felt, nosing, and flashing on a section of roofing at a brow eave above a set of first floor windows. This work needed to be accomplished before Employee #1's supervisor could install shingles. The supervisor was working directly above Employee #1 on the upper roof of the house. Employee #1 was working from an extension ladder set up in the driveway along the side of the house. As he nailed in flashing, Employee #1 lost his balance. The ladder slipped, causing him to fall down and to his left. Employee #1 landed on the driveway surface, a fall height of approximately 11 feet. Employee #1's supervisor heard Employee #1 yell as he fell, and from the supervisor's vantage point directly above, witnessed the last few feet of Employee #1's fall. Emergency services were called, and the Oakland Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital, where he was admitted and treated for a fractured chest. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the Oakland Fire Department at 9:45 a.m. on January 28, 2014. A Cal/OSHA compliance officer arrived at the site and began an investigation at 1:35 p.m. on January 28, 2014, before the employer had the opportunity to contact Cal/OSHA as required. The investigation determined that the employer was a roofing contractor who had been in business for five generations and specialized in re-roofing projects. When the fall occurred, Employee #1 was installing the new flashing to the roof's brow eave. The base of the ladder from which he was working rested on a sloping concrete driveway, with scrap lumber placed under the downhill foot of the ladder in an attempt to level the base. The feet of the ladder were not positively secured. The top of the ladder was resting against the wall just above the top of the window. The brow being re-roofed overhung the wall approximately 12 inches at this location and was approximately 14 feet 2 inches directly above the driveway surface. At the corner of the house where the slope of the driveway leveled out to horizontal, the brow was approximately 16 feet 2 inches above the driveway. The slope of the driveway between these points was approximately 10 degrees. The ladder was not tied, blocked, held, or otherwise secured to prevent slipping. The investigation concluded that this event's main causal factor was failure to secure the ladder. Other contributing factors included the lack of effective training of the injured employee, and the awkward positioning of the ladder on the sloping driveway and beneath the brow overhang.","Keywords: CHEST, FRACTURE, INSTALLING, ROOF, UNSECURED, LADDER, CONSTRUCTION, FALL, FALL PROTECTION, UNTRAINED",Single family or duplex dwelling,Alteration or rehabilitation,"Under $50,000",11,,,,Hospitalized injury,"Helpers, mechanics and repairers",62,50,55.0,46.0,9,30.26,09:53:00,55 °F,51 °F,86 %,S,30.24 in,0.0 in,Cloudy,94611,CA,Winter,5 mph,0 mph,37.8240957,-122.2325514,CA 94611,2014-01-28,,,,,

Their employer had tasked them to repair and hot mop a carport roof located in an alley behind the apartment. After they replaced the roof's rotten wood, they applied a layer of felt along the roof's southern edge. Employee #1, using a mop, then proceeded to brush hot asphalt along the edge of the roof, starting at the southeast corner of the roof and working the mop along the southern edge until he reached the southwest corner of the roof. Upon reaching the southwest corner, Employee #1 inadvertently stepped on a portion of the roof to which he had applied asphalt. He slipped and fell off the roof. Employee #1 fell head first approximately 8 feet 9 inches and landed on the cement floor below. Emergency services were called, and the Kern County Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital, where he was admitted and treated for a laceration of the liver and a head injury. He remained hospitalized for three days. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the Kern County Fire Department at 2:55 p.m. on January 11, 2014. The employer reported to Cal/OSHA at 4:00 p.m. on January 14, 2014. During the subsequent investigation, it was determined that employer was a roofing contractor primarily engaged in repairing and remodeling residential roofs. Employee #1 had been working directly for the employer for approximately 13 years. The investigation concluded that the immediate cause of Employee #1's fall was misjudgment of a hazardous situation.","Keywords: HEAD, INSTALLING, CONSTRUCTION, LIVER, LACERATION, ROOFER, FALL, FALL PROTECTION, SLIPPERY SURFACE, ASPHALT",Single family or duplex dwelling,Maintenance or repair,"Under $50,000",8,,,,Hospitalized injury,Roofers,63,42,41.0,35.0,7,29.73,12:54:00,58 °F,40 °F,51 %,CALM,29.68 in,0.0 in,Fair,93307,CA,Winter,0 mph,0 mph,35.3265484,-118.9690936,CA 93307,2014-01-11,,,,,

He climbed up an extension ladder to the roof. He then stood on a roof jack scaffold that had been installed on the roof. The roof jack came loose, and Employee #1 fell to the ground, along with the roof jack and other roofing material. The fall height was approximately 16 feet from the roof eave to the ground. Emergency services were called, and the San Francisco Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was admitted and treated for fractured hips.

The subsequent investigation established that Employee #1's foreman and multiple coworkers witnessed the fall. The foreman and these coworkers were interviewed. Employee #1, who was Spanish-speaking, was interviewed by a Cal/OSHA district manager who was fluent in Spanish. The employer was cited a serious violation of T8 CCR '1670(a), which requires employees to wear fall protection when sloped roof surfaces are steeper than 7:12. The slope where Employee #1 fell was steeper than 7:12. The Cal/OSHA roofing standards did not apply because the fall height was less than the minimum 20 feet from the eave to the ground specified in the standards. The employer was cited a violation of T8 CCR '342(a) for failing to report the serious employee injury within 8 hours of the incident. Other violations were documented during the investigation, and the employer was cited accordingly.","Keywords: FRACTURE, ROOF, CONSTRUCTION, EQUIPMENT FAILURE, ROOFER, FALL, FALL PROTECTION, HIP, WORK SURFACE, SCAFFOLD",Single family or duplex dwelling,Alteration or rehabilitation,"$50,000 to $250,000",24,,,,Hospitalized injury,Roofers,60,44,45.0,34.0,5,30.17,09:56:00,50 °F,41 °F,71 %,CALM,30.16 in,0.0 in,Partly Cloudy,94116,CA,Winter,0 mph,0 mph,37.7463201,-122.4732922,CA 94116,2014-01-02,,,,,

He was working with his helper, Coworker #1. They were installing membrane vapor barrier on the roof. Employee #1 fell off the roof and landed on a concrete floor approximately 8 feet below. The homeowner came out of the house and placed a call for emergency assistance. Employee #1 was transported to San Francisco General Hospital. After two days of observation at the hospital, he was admitted. Employee #1 was treated for a fractured arm and a concussion. The employer reported this event at approximately 4:12 p.m. on May 17, 2013, within the required time frame, to Cal/OSHA's San Mateo District Office. The subsequent investigation began on May 23, 2013. It included interviews and review of documents. However, despite multiple attempts to interview Employee #1, he did not cooperate. Coworker #1 also was unavailable for interview. The employer stated that Coworker #2, a foreman/supervisor who was out of state at the time of the fall, responded and went to the jobsite. Coworker #2 was interviewed during the investigation. Coworker #2 stated that he interviewed Coworker #1 after Employee #1's fall. He stated that Coworker #1 told him that both Employee #1 and Coworker #2 were installing membrane on the roof and were far away from the roof's edge when Coworker #2 suddenly realized that Employee #1 had vanished off the roof. Coworker #2 said he did not know the cause of the fall. The investigation further determined that the pitch of the roof was approximately 4:12, the roof was approximately 8 feet high, and the work activity was not a new construction. Under T8 CCR 1730, roofers are exempt from having fall protection if working at a height of less than 20 feet with some conditions. At the time of the investigation report, due to lack of Employee #1's cooperation, Cal/OSHA was unable to conclude whether the conditions of T8 1730 were violated by the Employer. Therefore, there was no plan to issue a citation.","Keywords: FRACTURE, INSTALLING, ROOF, CONSTRUCTION, ROOFER, FALL, FALL PROTECTION, ARM, CONCUSSION",Single family or duplex dwelling,Maintenance or repair,"Under $50,000",9,,,,Hospitalized injury,Construction laborers,64,54,56.0,51.0,22,30.09,14:53:00,63 °F,53 °F,70 %,W,30.08 in,0.0 in,Mostly Cloudy,94965,CA,Spring,20 mph,0 mph,37.8620315,-122.4979727,CA 94965,2013-05-15,,,,,

In a later interview, the homeowner stated that the job of replacing the roof was started on September 17, 2010, and finished by September 19, 2010. During the course of this investigation, involved workers and parties were interviewed. Some of the workers at the job site had been hired by other workers there. It was determined that the homeowner had a verbal or oral contract with his neighbor for this job. The homeowner was under the impression that his neighbor, Coworker #1, was a construction worker and that he would bring some coworkers from a licensed company with him. The workers, however, were not working for any licensed entity. Coworker #1 asked another worker, Coworker #2, to replace the roof. Coworker #2 told Coworker #1 that he would install the new roof but not tear off the old roof. With that knowledge, Coworker #1 told Coworker #2 that he, Coworker #1, could find some people standing outside a Home Depot to tear off the old roof. Coworker #2 disagreed with that notion, because those workers might not have roofing experience. Accordingly, Coworker #1 told Coworker # 2 to find workers who did have experience. Coworker #2 asked a friend from church, Coworker #3, who had two years of roofing experience, if he could pull off the old roof. Coworker #3 accepted this offer and told Coworker # 2 that he would do this job with the help of three other friends, Employee #1, Coworker #4, and Coworker #5, who were experienced. According to the homeowner, the agreement with Coworker #1 was to start the job on September 18, 2010. Coworker #1, though, called the homeowner early in the morning on September 17, 2010, and said that the workers were on their way to start the job. At approximately 7:00 a.m. on September 17, 2010, Coworker #2 took Coworker #3 up onto the roof to show him the job, and then Coworker #2 left. At that point, Employee #1, Coworker #4, and Coworker #5 went up onto the roof and started tearing it off. At around 9:00 a.m., Employee #1 fell off the roof. Coworker #3 witnessed this accident. Coworker #3 stated that Employee #1 was pulling off the roof, when he accidently stepped on a plastic gutter that was hanging from the edge of the roof. The gutter broke, and Employee #1 lost his balance and fell off the roof. The edge of the roof was approximately nine feet above the cement-paved backyard where Employee #1 landed. Employee # 1 sustained a serious head injury due to lacerations. The homeowner called emergency medical technicians immediately. Then the homeowner called Coworker #1, who was coordinating with the workers and was apparently not at the scene. The Santa Clara fire department arrived at the scene, and Employee #1 was sent to the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, where he died on the following day. Meanwhile, the Santa Clara fire department interviewed the involved parties. It was determined that the homeowner had hired unlicensed workers and an unlicensed contractor. The workers were not covered by an Injury Illness Prevention Program (I2P2, or IIPP) safety program. Thus, Employee #1 was exempt from needing fall protection under the Roofing Standard, because the height of the roof was less than 20 feet. Coworker #1 gave an estimate to the homeowner, arranged the labor, arranged the purchase of roofing material, handled the money, coordinated with the employer and laborers, and hired a truck to pick up the roofing trash and litter. It was determined that Coworker #1 acted as a general contractor. Therefore, Coworker #1 was cited for not having an IIPP safety program under CCR 1509 (a) and for not having a Code of Safe Practices under CCR 1509(b). Coworker #2 and Coworker # 3 were acting as subcontractors. Therefore, they were cited for not observing the Code of Safe Practices under 1509(b).

Employee #1 lost his balance and fell approximately seven to eight feet onto an asphalt floor, breaking his right elbow. He was hospitalized for ten days, and three surgeries were performed on his elbow. The coworker stated that the ladder was too heavy for one person to hold or secure, especially when Employee #1, who weighed 180 pounds, was on it. Employee #1 said that he had done this type of work many times before and that he had been trained by his employer. This time, however, it was hard for the coworker to hold the ladder when it started to shift to its side. Both workers said that the ladder's footing was approximately seven to eight feet away from the wall. The employer was cited for not ensuring that the ladder was blocked or secured enough for Employee #1 to climb it. The employer admitted that there should have been two people to hold this heavy, metal, twenty-four-foot ladder while Employee #1 was climbing it.","Keywords: FRACTURE, ROOF, LADDER, ROOFER, FALL, ELBOW, FALLING OBJECT, LOST BALANCE, UNSTABLE POSITION",Other building,Alteration or rehabilitation,"Under $50,000",15,,,,Hospitalized injury,Roofers,68,55,51.0,49.0,18,29.9,2:57 p.m,67 °F,51 °F,57 %,W,29.86 in,0.0 in,Fair,94010,CA,Summer,15 mph,0 mph,37.5820879,-122.3563195,CA 94010,2010-07-20,,,,,
